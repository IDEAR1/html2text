**John Kennedy**

On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in
office, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was killed by an assassin's bullets as his
motorcade wound through Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was the youngest man elected
President; he was the youngest to die.

Of Irish descent, he was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917.
Graduating from Harvard in 1940, he entered the Navy. In 1943, when his PT
boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave
injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety.

Back from the war, he became a Democratic Congressman from the Boston area,
advancing in 1953 to the Senate. He married Jacqueline Bouvier on September
12, 1953. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote
_Profiles in Courage_, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history.

In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President,
and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions
watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M.
Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the
first Roman Catholic President.

His Inaugural Address offered the memorable injunction: "Ask not what your
country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country." As President,
he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again. His
economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion
since World War II; before his death, he laid plans for a massive assault on
persisting pockets of privation and poverty.

Responding to ever more urgent demands, he took vigorous action in the cause
of equal rights, calling for new civil rights legislation. His vision of
America extended to the quality of the national culture and the central role
of the arts in a vital society.

He wished America to resume its old mission as the first nation dedicated to
the revolution of human rights. With the Alliance for Progress and the Peace
Corps, he brought American idealism to the aid of developing nations. But the
hard reality of the Communist challenge remained.

Shortly after his inauguration, Kennedy permitted a band of Cuban exiles,
already armed and trained, to invade their homeland. The attempt to overthrow
the regime of Fidel Castro was a failure. Soon thereafter, the Soviet Union
renewed its campaign against West Berlin. Kennedy replied by reinforcing the
Berlin garrison and increasing the Nation's military strength, including new
efforts in outer space. Confronted by this reaction, Moscow, after the
erection of the Berlin Wall, relaxed its pressure in central Europe.

Instead, the Russians now sought to install nuclear missiles in Cuba. When
this was discovered by air reconnaissance in October 1962, Kennedy imposed a
quarantine on all offensive weapons bound for Cuba. While the world trembled
on the brink of nuclear war, the Russians backed down and agreed to take the
missiles away. The American response to the Cuban crisis evidently persuaded
Moscow of the futility of nuclear blackmail.

Kennedy now contended that both sides had a vital interest in stopping the
spread of nuclear weapons and slowing the arms race--a contention which led to
the test ban treaty of 1963. The months after the Cuban crisis showed
significant progress toward his goal of "a world of law and free choice,
banishing the world of war and coercion." His administration thus saw the
beginning of new hope for both the equal rights of Americans and the peace of
the world.
